# AGI Studio Suite GODCORE Edition

This is a standalone AGI studio backend.

## Installation

To install the AGI Studio Suite, run the `install.sh` script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

This will create a virtual environment, install the required dependencies, and create a desktop shortcut.

## Uninstallation

To uninstall the AGI Studio Suite, run the `uninstall.sh` script:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

This will remove the virtual environment, the desktop shortcut, and all the project files.

## Usage

After installation, you can run the AGI Studio Suite by double-clicking the "AGI Studio" shortcut on your desktop. This will open a terminal window with the AGI Studio CLI.

You can also run the application from the command line:

```bash
./run_studio.py
```

The CLI supports the following commands:

*   `newgraph`: Start a new graph
*   `loadgraph [path]`: Load graph from file
*   `savegraph [path]`: Save current graph
*   `addnode [type]`: Add node to graph
*   `connect [src] [dst]`: Connect nodes
*   `train [epochs]`: Train for N epochs (dummy data)
*   `checkpoint`: Save checkpoint
*   `stats`: Show training stats
*   `quit` or `exit`: Save session & exit

## Victor Thought Engine

The `VictorThoughtEngine` is a core component of the AGI Studio Suite, designed to process events, generate thoughts, create directives, and dispatch actions.

### Improvements and Extensions

Here are some suggestions for improving and extending the `VictorThoughtEngine`:

*   **Advanced Tagging:** The current `tag_thought` method is very basic. This could be improved by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract more meaningful tags from the event payload. For example, you could use a library like NLTK or spaCy to perform named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:** The `generate_thought` and `generate_directive` methods could be replaced with machine learning models. For example, you could use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate thoughts based on a sequence of events, or a reinforcement learning agent to learn the best action to take in a given situation.
*   **More Sophisticated Action Dispatching:** The `ActionDispatcher` could be extended to support a wider range of actions, such as sending emails, making API calls, or controlling hardware devices. You could also add a system for managing and prioritizing actions.
*   **Long-Term Memory:** The `ThoughtEngine` currently only stores a short history of thoughts. You could add a long-term memory system to store and retrieve thoughts over longer periods of time. This would allow the AGI to learn from past experiences and make more informed decisions.
*   **User Interface:** You could create a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the thought process of the AGI. This would make it easier to understand how the AGI is making decisions and to debug any problems.
